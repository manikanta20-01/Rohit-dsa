## Daily Progress Log

### Date: [09-10-2023]
- **Progress:**
   Day 22/180 Introduction to Arrays in c++


1: Take 20 elements from user input and find its sum with the help of an array.

2: Calculate the average of elements in an array of size 18.

3: Find the index of a specific element in an array, if the element is nor present, print -1. Ask the size of the array from the user and then implement it.

4: Create an array of char types and store ‘a’ to ‘z’ in it. Then print the element of the arrays.

5: Find the second largest element in an array of unique elements of size n. Where n>3.

6: Find the third smallest element in an array of unique elements size n. Where n>3.

7: What is Byte addressable?
